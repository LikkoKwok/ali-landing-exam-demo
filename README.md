# Alibaba Cloud Landing Zone Exam - Infrastructure Summary
This summary serves to explain how my architecture can map with Alibaba Cloud Landing Zone 
Partner Certification Exam by addressing the specific requirements.

## 1. Organization, Accounts, and Resource Isolation
## Requirements
- Resources within each deployment environment (SIT, UAT, pre-production, production) must be fully isolated
- Personnel permissions must be isolated across environments
- Clean separation between traditional insurance business and AI workloads
- Project-level workspace isolation for AI teams (Claims vs Actuarial)
- GPU resource quotas and scheduling policies

## How My Architecture Addresses This
| Requirement | Implementation |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| Environment Isolation | 4 separate VPCs per environment (SIT, UAT, PreProd, Prod) for Core Insurance App, each with dedicated CIDR blocks and Security Groups |
| Business Separation | Dedicated VPCs for Core Insurance (10.1.0.0/16) and AI Lab (10.2.0.0/16) |
| AI Team Isolation | PAI Workspaces created for Claims and Actuarial teams with separate Resource Groups and Datasets |
| Network Isolation | Cross-environment blocking rules in Security Groups prevent SIT/UAT/PreProd from accessing Prod resources |
| GPU Quotas | ACK GPU node pool with auto-scaling (min_size=0, max_size=var.gpu_max_nodes) ensures dynamic GPU allocation |

## 2. Identity and Access Management
## Requirements
- Azure AD integration for SSO (single sign-on)
- Least privilege principle for all roles
- API key governance (per-application, rotated every 90 days)
- Service roles with temporary credentials (no long-lived access keys)

## How My Architecture Addresses This
| Requirement | Implementation |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| Azure AD SSO | SAML federation with Azure AD via "alicloud_ram_saml_provider" |
| RBAC Roles | Roles categorized into Infra Roles (e.g. Cloud Admin, DB Admin) and AI Roles (e.g. PAI Admin, ML Engineer, AI Auditor) |
| Federated Roles | Each role maps to a RAM role with sts:AssumeRole policy for Azure AD users |
| Least Privilege | Each role has scoped system policies (e.g., AliyunPAIReadOnlyAccess for model reviewers)
| API Key Governance | Per-application service role ai-claims-app-invoke with temporary credentials; API keys stored in self-managed KMS |

## 3. Financial Management
## Requirements
- Cost breakdown by business application and business line
- Granular cost attribution for GPU compute, training time, inference API calls, token consumption
- Resource groups and tags as primary cost attribution mechanism

# Useful commands:
## To update state with the existing architecture on cloud:
terraform refresh -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"

## Last Resort:
Delete state file in OSS:
aliyun oss rm oss://oss-alicloud-sso-demo-tfstate-01/landing-zone/state/terraform.tfstate

Clean local state:
run clean_apply.sh

## apply modules one by one to figure out bottleneck:

terraform apply -target=module.hub_security -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"
terraform apply -target=module.shared_service -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"
terraform apply -target=module.core_insurance_app -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"

terraform apply -target=module.pai_platform -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"
terraform apply -target=module.logging_account -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"
terraform apply -target=module.ai_data_security -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars"

## terraform destroy but ignore CEN and TR:
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/demo.tfvars" \
  -exclude=module.hub_security.data.alicloud_cen_instances.existing \
  -exclude=module.hub_security.alicloud_cen_transit_router_vpc_attachment.hub

## Manual delete from state file unwanted resources created by a specific module
terraform state list
terraform state rm module.<your_module_name>
